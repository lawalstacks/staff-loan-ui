  - **Admin:** can view all loan data
  - **Superadmin:** can view all data and delete loans
- API endpoint filtering by loan status (`/loans?status=...`)
- API endpoint for fetching all expired loans (`/loans/expired`)
- Global middleware for:
  - Security (`helmet`)
  - Logging (`morgan`)
  - Rate limiting (`throttler`)
  - CORS

### Frontend (Vue.js)

- Responsive login page built from Figma design
- API client with request interceptors to automatically send auth tokens
- State management with **Pinia** (`authStore`, `loanStore`)
- Token management using `sessionStorage`
- Password visibility toggle ("see/unsee")
- Protected dashboard route
- Dashboard for viewing, filtering, and deleting loans based on user role
